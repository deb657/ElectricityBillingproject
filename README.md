# ElectricityBillingproject
The primary objective of the Electricity Billing System is to keep track of invoices, customers, units, connections, and consumption. It keeps track of all bills, readings, purchases, and payments.

Electricity bills are the most significant communication tool between customers and power providers. Customers should receive fundamental information, as such as energy usage and unit cost, on their bills to help them understand their power use and spending, as well as their change in electricity consumption.

Benefits of using Electricity Billing System
----------------------------------------------
Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty have risen – Many people who are very busy would much rather deal with their bills electronically than with paper. In other words, if a business has a wide range of electronic payment types, more satisfied and loyal customers will be to the company they work for.

The number of customers has grown – Most people will choose to go to a business that accepts electronic payments over one that doesn’t, if they have a choice between them. Many young people don’t know how to write a paper check and don’t have a checking account.
